{\Large Procedure: }\\
Setup Kestrel powered via USB and running Serial Demo interface. Read output of a given Talon port using oscilloscope (for cross talk) and using logic analyzer (for more general measurement). 

Perform the following steps to test the isolation the signal lines of the Talon ports:
\begin{itemize}
\item Turn on power to just port being measured
\item Set \texttt{SELx} pin for given port \textbf{HIGH} in order to connect UART to output
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} and \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{OUTPUT} and drive \textbf{LOW}
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure correct reception at output (correct conversion by logic analyzer) - \textbf{Test ALPHA}
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} and \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{OUTPUT} and drive \textbf{HIGH}
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure correct reception at output (correct conversion by logic analyzer) - \textbf{Test BETA}
\item Set \texttt{SELx} pin for given port \textbf{LOW} in order to connect GPIO to output
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} and \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{INPUT} 
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Measure cross talk from serial lines on output and absolute value of disturbed signal - \textbf{Measure 1}
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} as \textbf{OUTPUT} 
\item Set PWM signal on \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA}, confirm output correctness, measure cross talk on GPIOB output and absolute value of disturbed signal - \textbf{Test GAMMA}, \textbf{Measure 2}
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{OUTPUT}, set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} as \textbf{INPUT} 
\item Set PWM signal on \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB}, confirm output correctness, measure cross talk on GPIOA output and absolute value of disturbed signal - \textbf{Test DELTA}, \textbf{Measure 3}
\item Turn on power to all ports 
\item Set \texttt{SELx} pin for given port \textbf{HIGH} in order to connect UART to output
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} and \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{OUTPUT} and drive \textbf{LOW}
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure correct reception at output (correct conversion by logic analyzer) - \textbf{Test EPSILON}
\item Set \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOA} and \texttt{TALONx\_GPIOB} as \textbf{OUTPUT} and drive \textbf{HIGH}
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure correct reception at output (correct conversion by logic analyzer) - \textbf{Test ZETA}
\item Turn power off on given port, leave on for all other ports
\item Set \texttt{SELx} pin for given port \textbf{HIGH} in order to connect UART to output
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure lack of signal at output, measure output amplitude - \textbf{Test ETA}, \textbf{Measure 4}
\item Connect logic analyzer to different port 
\item Set \texttt{SELx} pin for this new port \textbf{HIGH} in order to connect UART to output
\item Send serial message at 115200 baud rate. Ensure correct reception at output (correct conversion by logic analyzer) - \textbf{Test THETA}
