{\Large Procedure: }\\
Take Gonk with batteries removed, connect power supply in place of battery (with $1\Omega$ in series with a $1000\mu \text{F}$ capacitor). 

We will test to obtain: Minimum start up voltage, UVP voltage, OVP voltage, OCD current, and restart conditions

{\Large \textbf{Start Up Voltage:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Turn power supply off
\item Connect DMM to output of Gonk
\item Switch Gonk \textbf{ON} 
\item Set power supply for 2.5V
\item Turn on power supply
\item Press \textbf{JUMP} button on Gonk
\item Check DMM to verify if output is connected 
\item Turn off power supply, increment voltage by 0.1V and turn power supply back on
\item Repeat process until output is connected, record voltage 
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{UVP Voltage:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Turn power supply off
\item Connect DMM to output of Gonk
\item Switch Gonk \textbf{ON} 
\item Set power supply for 3.7V
\item Turn on power supply
\item Press \textbf{JUMP} button on Gonk
\item Reduce voltage by increments of 0.1V, delay at least 1 second between each step
\item Continue reducing voltage until the output is disconnected, record this voltage 
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{UVP Restart:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Place the device into UVP mode (see UVP Voltage action items)
\item Connect an additional power supply to the external port of Gonk
\item Set voltage to 2.5V
\item Set DMM to measure voltage on internal battery rail 
\item Switch power supply on
\item Check DMM to see if charge voltage is applied 
\item Increment charge voltage by 0.1V, delaying at least 1 second between increments
\item Repeat until charge voltage is connected to battery rail
\item Record UVP restart voltage 
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{OVP Voltage:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Connect secondary power supply to input of Gonk
\item Connect DMM to artificial Gonk battery input
\item Switch Gonk \textbf{ON} 
\item Set battery power supply for 3.7V
\item Turn on power supply
\item Set input power supply for 3.7V
\item Turn on power supply
\item Increase input voltage by increments of 50mV, delay at least 1 second between each step
\item Continue increasing voltage until the input is disconnected disconnected from the battery, record this voltage 
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{OCD Current:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item For this step, remove the series resistor to the power supply
\item Connect DMM in series measuring current
\item Set DMM for min/max mode
\item Set battery power supply to 3.7V with a current limit max $>5 \text{A}$
\item Connect load resistor
\item Increase load current until output disconnects
\item Record maximum current measured 
\end{itemize}

{\Large \textbf{OCD Restart:}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Place the device into OCD mode (see OCD Current action items)
\item Remove load from output
\item Leave battery power supply at 3.7V
\item Test that output did \textbf{not} restore connection as a result of this
\item Connect an additional power supply to the external port of Gonk
\item Set voltage to 2.5V
\item Set DMM to measure voltage on internal battery rail 
\item Switch power supply on
\item Check DMM to see if charge voltage is applied 
\item Increment charge voltage by 0.1V, delaying at least 1 second between increments
\item Repeat until charge voltage is connected to battery rail
\item Record OCD restart voltage 
\end{itemize}
